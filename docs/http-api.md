# HTTP API Contract

What the JSON gateway guarantees, independent of any single product. The
per-endpoint request and response shapes live in the generated OpenAPI spec
(`jsonserver/openapi/`).

## Request rules

- **`Content-Type: application/json` is required** on every POST. Anything else
  is `415`.
- **The body must be non-empty** and at most **10 MiB**. An empty or
  whitespace-only body is `400`; an oversized one is `413`.
- **Dates are ISO-8601 `YYYY-MM-DD`, exactly.** Slash formats and impossible
  dates (`2024-02-30`) are rejected with
  `Invalid date '<value>': expected YYYY-MM-DD`. Response dates are ISO too.
- **Omitted is not defaulted.** A field the product needs but the request does
  not carry is an error naming the field (`Schedule.calendar is required`) —
  never a silent zero, and never a silently chosen convention. This covers
  schedule and leg conventions, day counters, curve-helper quotes, product
  discriminators (`fra_type`, `cap_floor_type`, CDS `side`), and volatility
  specs. See `versioning.md` for the full list introduced in 0.2.0.
- **Presence, not sentinels, selects a variant.** Where several quote forms are
  accepted (`rate` / `price` / `spread` / `quote_id`), supply exactly the one
  you mean; supplying none is an error, and a genuine `0` is representable.

## Status codes

The gateway maps the engine's gRPC status onto HTTP:

| HTTP | When |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Priced. List endpoints may still carry per-item errors in the body. |
| `400` | Invalid argument: missing required field, malformed date, or an unsupported combination of otherwise-valid fields. |
| `401` / `403` | Reserved; the shipped server does not authenticate. |
| `404` | Unknown route, or a referenced id (curve, model, volatility, credit curve, index, quote) that is not present in the request's `pricing` block. |
| `409` | Reserved. |
| `413` | Body over the 10 MiB cap, or a gRPC message over the transport cap. |
| `415` | `Content-Type` is not `application/json`. |
| `422` | Well-formed request the pricing engine could not evaluate — a QuantLib-level failure such as a degenerate schedule or an unbootstrappable curve. |
| `429` | Resource exhausted for a reason other than payload size. |
| `500` | Unexpected server fault. |
| `501` | A field or combination that is on the wire but not implemented. |
| `503` | No worker available. |
| `504` | The request's deadline or server-side budget expired (see `QUANTRA_REQUEST_BUDGET_MS` in `configuration.md`). |

The distinction that matters most: **`400` means the request is wrong, `422`
means the request is well-formed but unpriceable.** Retrying either without
changing the payload will not help.

## Error body

Every non-2xx response is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "error": "Schedule.calendar is required",
  "code": 3,
  "code_name": "INVALID_ARGUMENT",
  "message": "Schedule.calendar is required"
}
```

`error` carries the real cause and is the field to read. `code` /
`code_name` are the underlying gRPC status, kept for compatibility;
`message` repeats `error`.

## Headers

| Header | Direction | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `X-Quantra-Api-Version` | response | The served API version, from the `VERSION` file. Matches OpenAPI `info.version` and `GET /meta`. Present on every POST response, success or failure. |
| `X-Request-Id` | request → response | If you send one, it is sanitized (printable non-space ASCII, capped at 128 characters), forwarded to the engine as gRPC metadata, tagged onto every engine log line for that request, and echoed back. If you do not send one, none is echoed. |

Send an `X-Request-Id` on anything you may need to trace: it is the only way to
correlate a client-side failure with the engine log lines that produced it.

## Service endpoints

| Endpoint | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | Liveness. Cheap; no engine round-trip. |
| `GET /meta` | Service and version metadata: API version, build info, the product list, and the endpoint list. |
| `GET /status` | Runtime status, including Envoy worker membership when `QUANTRA_ENVOY_ADMIN` is set. |

## gRPC callers

The same contract applies, minus the HTTP mapping: the engine returns the gRPC
status directly (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `ABORTED`, `UNIMPLEMENTED`,
`DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, …) with the real cause in the status message. `Meta` and
`grpc.health.v1.Health` are described in `client.md`.
